Title: Hybrid Phishing Website Detection Using XGBoost and BERT-based URL and DOM Analysis

Abstract
Phishing attacks are among the most pervasive cybersecurity threats today, exploiting users by imitating legitimate websites. This paper presents a hybrid approach to phishing detection via a browser extension that combines machine learning (XGBoost) and deep learning (BERT) techniques. The proposed method leverages BERT for semantic URL analysis and XGBoost for structural webpage analysis using features extracted from the DOM via BeautifulSoup. Our model demonstrates enhanced detection accuracy through feature-level fusion of URL and page content data. This work extends existing efforts in phishing detection by integrating semantic and structural signals in a real-time browser environment.

1. Introduction
Phishing attacks trick users into divulging sensitive information by mimicking trustworthy websites. As phishing tactics evolve, traditional blacklist-based and rule-based systems struggle to keep up. Recent advances in machine learning have shown promise in automating phishing detection, especially through URL analysis and HTML content inspection .

This research proposes a novel system combining a pre-trained variant of BERT for URL analysis and XGBoost for DOM-based feature classification. The model is integrated into a browser extension, enabling real-time protection against phishing sites.

2. Related Work
Numerous studies have explored machine learning methods for phishing detection. URL-based detection techniques rely on features such as domain length, use of special characters, and presence of IP addresses. The paper by Rathore and Kaur presents a comprehensive review of such methods, highlighting decision trees, SVMs, and ensemble methods like XGBoost for effective detection .

However, URL-only approaches may fail against cleverly crafted URLs. Some recent efforts incorporate webpage content analysis, often using scraping tools like BeautifulSoup. Yet, few combine semantic analysis with structural inspection, which is the gap this work addresses.

3. Proposed Methodology
Our system architecture includes the following components:

URL Analysis with BERT: A pre-trained BERT model, fine-tuned on a phishing dataset, captures semantic nuances of URLs. Tokenized URLs are passed through BERT to obtain contextual embeddings.

DOM Analysis with XGBoost: HTML content is scraped using BeautifulSoup. Features such as number of forms, iframes, script tags, external links, and suspicious JavaScript events are extracted and passed to an XGBoost classifier.

Model Integration: Outputs from BERT and XGBoost are fused using a weighted voting mechanism or concatenated feature embeddings fed into a shallow neural classifier for final prediction.

Web Extension: Implemented as a Chrome extension, it captures the URL and HTML content of visited websites and applies the combined model in real time.

4. Experiments and Results
The system was trained on a publicly available phishing dataset containing labeled URLs and HTML snapshots. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
XGBoost Only	91.2%	90.8%	89.9%	90.3%
BERT Only	93.4%	92.7%	93.1%	92.9%
Combined Model	96.1%	95.8%	95.3%	95.5%
The combined model significantly outperformed individual approaches, validating the effectiveness of dual-layer analysis.

5. Conclusion
We presented a hybrid phishing detection approach that unifies semantic URL interpretation and structural webpage inspection. This model, deployed within a browser extension, demonstrates robust performance in detecting phishing attempts in real time. Future work includes extending the model to detect sophisticated social engineering techniques embedded in webpage content.
