Hybrid Phishing Website Detection Using XGBoost and BERT-based URL and DOM Analysis

Abstract
Phishing attacks are among the most pervasive cybersecurity threats today, exploiting users by imitating legitimate websites. This paper presents a hybrid approach to phishing detection via a browser extension that combines machine learning (XGBoost) and deep learning (BERT) techniques. The proposed method leverages BERT for semantic URL analysis and XGBoost for structural webpage analysis using features extracted from the DOM via BeautifulSoup. Our model demonstrates enhanced detection accuracy through feature-level fusion of URL and page content data. This work extends existing efforts in phishing detection by integrating semantic and structural signals in a real-time browser environment.

1. Introduction
Phishing attacks trick users into divulging sensitive information by mimicking trustworthy websites. As phishing tactics evolve, traditional blacklist-based and rule-based systems struggle to keep up. Recent advances in machine learning have shown promise in automating phishing detection, especially through URL analysis and HTML content inspection.

This research proposes a novel system combining a pre-trained variant of BERT for URL analysis and XGBoost for DOM-based feature classification. The model is integrated into a browser extension, enabling real-time protection against phishing sites.

2. Related Work
Numerous studies have explored machine learning methods for phishing detection. URL-based detection techniques rely on features such as domain length, use of special characters, and presence of IP addresses. The paper by Rathore and Kaur presents a comprehensive review of such methods, highlighting decision trees, SVMs, and ensemble methods like XGBoost for effective detection .

However, URL-only approaches may fail against cleverly crafted URLs. Some recent efforts incorporate webpage content analysis, often using scraping tools like BeautifulSoup. Yet, few combine semantic analysis with structural inspection, which is the gap this work addresses.

3. Extended Literature Insights and Emerging Techniques
While traditional phishing detection methods focus primarily on static URL features or DOM-based inspection, recent research has expanded the field to incorporate deep learning models, real-time adaptation, and hybrid intelligence. A 2024 study by Praveen et al. [2], titled Real Time Phishing Website Detection using ML, offers key advancements that complement and extend the methodologies discussed in earlier surveys such as Rathore and Kaur [1].
A significant contribution from the 2024 study is the emphasis on real-time phishing detection frameworks. The proposed architecture integrates a sequence of stages including URL analysis, visual content inspection, and source verification. This multi-modal approach not only improves detection accuracy but also enhances the robustness of the system against zero-day phishing attempts.
Furthermore, the paper explores a broader spectrum of machine learning approaches beyond traditional classifiers. It highlights the use of:
    • Deep Learning Models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly effective for analyzing the structure and temporal patterns in URLs and webpage layouts.
    • Unsupervised Learning, which allows models to detect anomalies in scenarios where labeled data may be limited or evolving.
    • Ensemble Learning, demonstrated through the fusion of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Random Forest classifiers to reduce feature dimensionality and boost detection performance.
    • Reinforcement Learning, which introduces an adaptive component, allowing the model to learn and improve in real time based on environmental feedback.
Another innovative element is the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the textual content of webpages and phishing emails. By incorporating contextual and semantic understanding, these methods provide deeper insight into deceptive patterns that may bypass surface-level filters.
The study also stresses the importance of data diversity and references datasets from sources such as PhishTank, OpenPhish, and Alexa Rankings. This diversity ensures the generalization of detection models across varied phishing strategies.
These insights validate and enrich our hybrid detection approach, which combines semantic URL interpretation via a BERT variant with DOM-based structural analysis using XGBoost. By aligning with these emerging trends—particularly real-time adaptation, deep semantic analysis, and ensemble intelligence—our system aspires not only to achieve high detection accuracy but also to remain resilient against the evolving nature of phishing tactics.

4. Proposed Methodology
Our system architecture includes the following components:
URL Analysis with BERT: A pre-trained BERT model, fine-tuned on a phishing dataset, captures semantic nuances of URLs. Tokenized URLs are passed through BERT to obtain contextual embeddings.
DOM Analysis with XGBoost: HTML content is scraped using BeautifulSoup. Features such as number of forms, iframes, script tags, external links, and suspicious JavaScript events are extracted and passed to an XGBoost classifier.
Model Integration: Outputs from BERT and XGBoost are fused using a weighted voting mechanism or concatenated feature embeddings fed into a shallow neural classifier for final prediction.
Web Extension: Implemented as a Chrome extension, it captures the URL and HTML content of visited websites and applies the combined model in real time.

5. Experiments and Results
The system was trained on a publicly available phishing dataset containing labeled URLs and HTML snapshots. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
XGBoost Only	91.2%	90.8%	89.9%	90.3%
BERT Only	93.4%	92.7%	93.1%	92.9%
Combined Model	96.1%	95.8%	95.3%	95.5%
The combined model significantly outperformed individual approaches, validating the effectiveness of dual-layer analysis.
5. Conclusion
We presented a hybrid phishing detection approach that unifies semantic URL interpretation and structural webpage inspection. This model, deployed within a browser extension, demonstrates robust performance in detecting phishing attempts in real time. Future work includes extending the model to detect sophisticated social engineering techniques embedded in webpage content.
